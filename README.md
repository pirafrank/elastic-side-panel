# Elastic side panel

A side panel with an elastic animation ready to be deployed.

#### Whaaaat ?

This repo is based on [this article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/09/16/off-canvas-menu-effects/) source. I just took the example I like the most and edited it to work without any CSS conflicts on any project. 

#### How to use it

Get the [latest version](https://github.com/pirafrank/elastic-side-panel/archive/master.zip), unzip and enjoy!
