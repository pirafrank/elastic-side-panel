# Elastic side panel

A side panel with an elastic animation ready to be deployed without conflicts with your existing project.

#### Whaaaat ?

This repo is based on [this article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/09/16/off-canvas-menu-effects/) source. I just took the example I like the most and edited it to work without any CSS conflicts on any project. 

#### Demo?
